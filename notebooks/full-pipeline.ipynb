The campaign is endorsed by various organizations, including firefighters and police officers, who insist on a \"better City\" for all residents. The text also highlights the need to vote in favor of the construction of a Public Safety Building, which has failed multiple times during earthquakes in Santa Monica, and the importance of ensuring that 911 emergency services are adequately funded and maintained.
